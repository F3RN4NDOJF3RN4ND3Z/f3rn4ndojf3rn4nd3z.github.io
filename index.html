          <h1>Learnning Path</h1>
          <p>Always interested on learnning Open Source technologies and passionate for Video Games I started my Carrer as a Java Developer I got 6 years of experience on this, developing SOA and BPM for the inssurance field.</p>  
          <p>But I wanted to explore a new Technology that passionate me, so I decided take a Video Game Development Course.</p>
          <p>So I started learnning Unity, it was the 2013 when I met 3GOVideo and the VR at the same time. When Oculus gives this a new hype.</p>
          <p>But Oculus devices were very expensive and the PC specifications to run smoothly VR were expensive too. There were no 360 Video apps in Android and the google cardboard was my best option to give this a try. So I started studying Android and I decided to start developing the 360 VR app.</p>
          <p>When I finished this Android application and deliver the 360 Video VR app for 3GOVideo, then I decided to luch it for IOS so I developed it using swift but it was to expensive to mantain in the apple store so we leave only the Android version.</p>
          <p>Unity was good to create VR apps when they included the video decoding feautres there and it became really easy to make VR video apps, then there were developed also lots of assets in the Unity store. But It became a real nightmare when lots VR devices where developed so deliver an app that worked with each device required porting it to all the avaliable SDKs, and more development time to deliver a product.</p>
          <p>While the VR was evolving very fast  AR a technology was emerging again. I met AR in its first times with Wikitude. I knew in that momment it was a the unknown sister of VR. It started getting tracition when Pokkemon Go was release. I get captured also by this technology so I startred to learn how to make this in this too.</p>
          <p>In that time the only way that I knew on how to create AR apps was with Unity and ARtoolkit with open source technologies. Or pay a license of Vuforia.</p>
          <p>The experience in AR was not good with the jittering problems and light conditions when you loose trakking of a marker</p>
          <p>Until here Unity was the only way I knew for creating interactive apps.</p>
          <p>So webGL starts developing a new Standard to try to make the delivery of VR and AR apps compatible with all the devices.</p>
          <p>AFrame was also announced and it was a nice to have so I started learnning JS, HTML and CSS to jump into the WWW</p>
          <p>Oculus were aquired by facebook and React360 was also nice to have so I started learnning React to start working with this technologies</p>
          <p>Today I am a beliver of web technologies and how VR and AR can be potencialized with Open Standars and open source technoligies.</p>
